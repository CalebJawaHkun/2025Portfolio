        "The project is about a battleship mini game. The game play is simple as it involves only the player and programmed Computer going one-on-one to guess the other's hidden ship on the map. Gameplay involves picking and placing the chosen ships on a board and going to guessing battle. And whoever guesses all the ships first wins. The project is built mainly using vanilla React with CRA and with the help of ReactDND(Drag-and-drop) library. As the library specifies, the project was focused on constructing a DND feature during Ship Placement phase on the board. As one of the first project built using React, it taught me various fundamentals of react project construction.",

In the game, player selects one of the 5 animated characters provides and wonders around a set jungle area to explore the hidden minigames to partake in them. It is a relaxing web-based compilation of minigames built with the theme of wondering in nature with interactive UIs and relaxing setting. The project was built mainly on React CRA using React-Howler, Framer-motion, React Howl and Sprite-animator for character animation. The project included extra interactive features such as SFX, character control and extra animated VFXs with Framer-motion. The project used a custom router built Switching and React-context as the main architecture rather than using React Router. Overall, building the project from absolute ground up pushed me to implementing and appreciating a proper scalable application architecture design.",
